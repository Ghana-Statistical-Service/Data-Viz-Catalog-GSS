Bar/Column Charts
Bar/column charts should be used for comparisons. The bars should be sorted with values in ascending order (from largest to smallest). The only exceptions are for the other category and none which can be placed at the last position. Bars of these graphs should have a gap width of 30%.

Stacked Bar/Column Charts
Stacked bar/column charts should be used to compare the composition of different groups. It is best to utilize percentages so that the heights of all the bars will be equal.

Line Graphs
Line graphs should be used to present trends over time or for continuous variables such as age or ordered categories such as educational level. 

Scatter Plots
Scatter plots can be used to compare two variables in order to illustrate the correlation between two.

Dot/Range Plots
